AI
==

For our database class, this was our third project, based on creating a game and creating a computer player which a human could play against. In order to make a decent AI, the algorithm needed to look four steps in advance or go down a minimax tree, 4 levels deep. However, I wanted to make a better AI by creating a AI that looked eight steps in advance which could also fit in the 15 second time limit requirement put on by the specifications of the project.
